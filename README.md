# Data And Analytics Platform Capability Assessment

> This repo contains collateral that provides organisations with a framework for assessing their level of maturity or capability 
> within the sphere of data and analytics. 

# Introduction 
The primary objective of this repository is to provide a list of "features" or "capabilities" that could be considered indicators or oragnisational maturity within the area of data and analytics. In order to assist with the creation of such a list we broadly define the area as data and analytics using the simple conceptual model shown below.

Using the model shown above we categorise our "features" into 6 primary "variants" of data and analytics:
1. Data Lake
2. Agile Bi 
3. Modern Data Warehouse
4. Machine Learning & Data Science Exploration
5. Real-Time Analytics
6. OLTP Databases

## Viewing and Collaborating on the Core Feature List
The core reporistory consists of an issues list. An issue has been created for each "feature" that is considered an indicator of maturity. You can view and collaborate on the features using the standard issue list (https://github.com/microsoft/azure-data-services-go-fast-capability-assessment/issues) contained in this repository.

If you wish to view and interact with a summary report containing these issues please got to the Power BI report found at the link below:

## Performing an Assessment and Getting a Maturity Score
The issues list contained in this repository can be used to carry out a "self" assessment and obtain a capability or maturity score for each of the data and analytics variants. To do this please carry out the following steps:

1. Download and fill out the orange columns in the [Excel Assessment Template](/AssessmentDocuments/Foundations%20Collateral%20List%20-%20DevOps%20Template.xlsx). 
2. Download the Assessment Power BI Report [Power BI Assessment Template](/AssessmentDocuments/Assessment%20-%20Power%20BI.pbix) and use it to generate your capability scores. Note you will need to point the Power BI Assessment template to your version of the Excel Assessment Template. Do this by editing the Power BI File parameters. 
3. Download the [Power Point Assessment Template](/AssessmentDocuments/Power%20Point%20Assessment%20Template.pptx). Modify this template to create a maturity assessment summary presentation. 

Once the process is complete you will be able to generate charts similar to those shown below:
